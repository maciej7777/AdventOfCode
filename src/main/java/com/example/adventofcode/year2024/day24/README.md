Circuit provided in the task is an example of a [Ripple-carry_adder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics)#Ripple-carry_adder). 
Part 1 of the task requires only to implement code that calculates the result of any circuit. Part 2 is more complicated. 
It requires to fix the connections in the circuit, so that the result circuit calculates the sum of x and y in z 
(where each of them contains multiple bits). That task can be completed either manually (using solution for part 1 
as a status checker) or programmatically using set of predefined rules (to find the connections that should not happen).
