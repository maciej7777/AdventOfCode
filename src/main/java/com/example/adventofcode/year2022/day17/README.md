# Solution description
The solution for part 1 is relatively easy and requires simulating the rocks positions in the cave (and counting the height after the simulation finishes).
Part 2 of the task requires more work. Simulating all the steps would take significant amount of time. But we can try to skip many iterations by finding "cycles" - sequence of steps after which the top of rock tower is the same and external conditions (wind + next rock shape) are also the same. We can save simulation state each time when rocks are in rest and try to find the same state later. The state consists of wind condition ('>' or '<'), shape number and relative height of each cave column (which is calculated for each column by subtracting from current column height the minimal column height). Together with the state (value) we need to save the tower height and current iteration number. When we find the same state in the future we can calculate how much did our tower "grow" during the cycle and how many iterations are part of the cycle. This will allow us to skip as many cycles as possible before we reach our iterations limit.
