# AdventOfCode

Advent of code (https://adventofcode.com/about) is an event driven by Eric Wastl (https://bsky.app/profile/was.tl). Following the description from the
page, Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels
that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university
coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

In this repository I paste my solutions for Advent of Code puzzles
in [2022](src/main/java/com/example/adventofcode/year2022/README.md),
[2023](src/main/java/com/example/adventofcode/year2023/README.md)
and [2024](src/main/java/com/example/adventofcode/year2024/README.md). Each solution is provided in a separated
directory, there are also test directories added. The repository does not contain the input data, as the owner of
Advent of code asked directly not to share it. In my setup those files are saved in the private submodule
AdventOfCodeData. If you want to run the code you will need to put your input data in that directory and organise it 
in directories by year and day.
