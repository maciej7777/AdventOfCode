# AdventOfCode

Advent of code (https://adventofcode.com/about) is an event driven by Eric Wastl. Following the description from the
page, Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels
that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university
coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

In this repository I paste my solutions for Advent of Code puzzles
in [2022](src/main/java/com/example/adventofcode/year2022/README.md), 
[2023](src/main/java/com/example/adventofcode/year2023/README.md)
and [2024](src/main/java/com/example/adventofcode/year2024/README.md). Each solution is provided in a separated
directory, there are also test directories added.
